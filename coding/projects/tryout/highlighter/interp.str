An actual functional example
"now this is a string"
this is not a string
"this is an <interpolated> string and <it works> multiple times"

"we can escape chars \< \" \> "
"not on multiple 
lines though since it ends the match at a $
Then continues to <expression> the next state"

" bla bla multiline interpolation < will also succeed 
	some random interpolated stuff
> empty strings not supported"
